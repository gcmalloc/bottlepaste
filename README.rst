bottlepaste
-----------

A command line pastebin akin to `sprunge.us <http://sprunge.us/>`_ but using
`bottle.py <http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/bottle.py>`_ as webframework and
`MongoDB <http://www.mongodb.org/>`_ via `PyMongo
<http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/>`_ as storage.

The author deploys it on `cloudControl <https://www.cloudcontrol.com/>`_ using
a MongoDB provided by `mongolab <https://www.mongolab.com/home>`_ as:

* `bottlepaste.zetatech.org <http://bottlepaste.zetatech.org/>`_
* `bottlepaste.cloudcontrolled.com <http://bottlepaste.cloudcontrolled.com/>`_

Enjoy!

Stability
---------

This software is in alpha stage. Don't depend in any way on the links.

``index.html``
--------------

The main page use a variation of the docutils ``voidspace.css`` and ``vs.css``
for syntax highlighting. Because docutils is too difficult to use from python,
we chose an interim solution and the index page is checked into the repository
for now and then templated inside bottlepaste with a URL. The styles are
embedded.

To regenerate the page
use::

    $ rst2html.py --stylesheet-path=bottlepaste.css,vs.css index.rst index.tpl

Deployment
----------

The cloudControl specific customizations and files  are stored in the
``custom`` branch. When deploying, the ``custom`` branch is rebased onto the
local master, then pushed to ``master`` on the remote side and then deployed as
the ``default`` deployment. See the ``magic.sh`` script for how it's done.
Incidentally, since cloudControl uses ``buildpacks`` you *should* be able tp
deploy this app to heroku too.

TODO
----

* pygments highlighting
* cron to clean db
* info.html to show info and statistics
* pasteform
